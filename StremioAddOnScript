🛠️ Step 1: Understand the Basics of Stremio Addons
Stremio uses a universal addon system based on Node.js and HTTP/REST APIs. The addons are modular services that Stremio can call for:

Catalogs (lists of media)

Meta (info about a media item)

Streams (sources to play from)

Subtitles

Other stuff (like recommendations or search)

Each addon is registered through a manifest.json, which describes what it provides.

💡 What You Want to Build: “ChatGPT Recommended” Addon
🧠 Your Goals:
Use your ChatGPT account to generate personalized movie/show suggestions.

Show it in Stremio under a new catalog tab like “ChatGPT Recommended.”

Optionally filter based on mood, genre, past history, etc.

🔧 Step 2: Tools You’ll Need
Node.js (latest LTS version)

Stremio Addon SDK

Your own ChatGPT API key (from OpenAI)

A server or local Node server to run the addon (can be hosted free with services like Render or Railway)

📦 Step 3: Starter Code
Here’s a very basic Stremio addon that exposes a dummy catalog, which we’ll later hook into ChatGPT:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm init -y
npm install stremio-addon-sdk openai
Then create index.js:

js
Copy
Edit
const { addonBuilder } = require("stremio-addon-sdk");
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");

const builder = new addonBuilder({
    id: "org.chatgpt.recommendations",
    version: "1.0.0",
    name: "ChatGPT Recommended",
    description: "Recommendations based on GPT-generated prompts",
    catalogs: [
        {
            type: "movie",
            id: "chatgpt-movies",
            name: "ChatGPT Recommended",
        }
    ],
    resources: ["catalog"],
    types: ["movie"]
});

// Your OpenAI key (replace with env var in production)
const openai = new OpenAIApi(new Configuration({
    apiKey: "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}));

builder.defineCatalogHandler(async ({ id, type }) => {
    if (id !== "chatgpt-movies") return { metas: [] };

    const prompt = `Give me a list of 10 popular but underrated sci-fi movies for a tech-savvy user who likes philosophical themes. Return title and year.`;

    const gptResponse = await openai.createChatCompletion({
        model: "gpt-4",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
    });

    const results = gptResponse.data.choices[0].message.content;

    // Parse GPT output (you’ll probably want to return actual IMDb IDs)
    const metas = results.split("\n").filter(Boolean).map((line, i) => {
        const match = line.match(/(\d+\.)?\s*(.*)\s\((\d{4})\)/);
        if (!match) return null;
        return {
            id: `chatgpt-movie-${i}`,
            type: "movie",
            name: match[2],
            year: match[3],
            poster: "https://via.placeholder.com/150?text=GPT+Pick",
            description: "Recommended by ChatGPT"
        };
    }).filter(Boolean);

    return { metas };
});

module.exports = builder.getInterface();
🌐 Step 4: Run It Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
node index.js
Use something like ngrok to expose the local server publicly so Stremio can access it:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx ngrok http 7000
📄 Step 5: Test It in Stremio
Go to Stremio → Add-ons → Community Add-ons → Install via URL

Paste your ngrok URL (e.g. https://1234.ngrok.io/manifest.json)

You should now see ChatGPT Recommended under movie catalogs

🔮 Advanced Features to Add Later
Use user profiles or tokens to personalize (you’d have to proxy GPT using auth keys)

Add filters like genre or mood

Connect to watch history (if you're willing to dig into Stremio DB or cookies)

Serve actual stream links by scraping or using APIs like TMDB/Trakt/Real-Debrid

🧠 Can ChatGPT Give Real Recommendations?
Absolutely—it can be used to:

Curate genre blends ("give me gothic romance with tech dystopia")

Suggest lesser-known titles based on niche tastes

Even recommend across eras, studios, or regions

You can expand this by making GPT the backend brain of multiple catalog tabs.


🚫 Why You Can’t Directly Link ChatGPT Plus to Your Addon
Here’s the deal:


Feature	ChatGPT Plus (chat.openai.com)	OpenAI API
✅ Chat in browser	Yes	No
✅ Use GPT-4	Yes	Yes (with cost)
✅ Use in your own code	❌	✅
✅ Generate custom content (like catalogs)	❌	✅
✅ Authentication with API keys	❌	✅
ChatGPT Plus doesn’t give you an API key, and OpenAI intentionally separates the accounts for security and monetization reasons.

🌀 What Could Work (Risky or Hacky Paths)
⚠️ Option 1: Browser Automation (Unofficial, Fragile)
You could technically:

Use Puppeteer or Playwright (Node.js browser automation tools)

Log into your ChatGPT Plus account (you’d have to save cookies/tokens manually)

Script it to send prompts and scrape replies from the UI

Parse that and feed it into Stremio

Risks:
Very fragile. One UI update and it breaks.

Could get your account banned for ToS violations.

Can’t scale well.

Requires launching a full browser in the background every time a user opens the Stremio tab.

Only do this if you’re experimenting locally for fun and not sharing with others.

🧠 Option 2: Proxy from ChatGPT UI to Backend (Still hacky)
You run a local app that:

Opens ChatGPT web in a hidden browser

Sends prompts through your logged-in session

Intercepts the responses and converts them into JSON

Feeds that into your addon

This is basically option 1 but with more structure.

✅ Option 3: Free Trial of OpenAI API (~$5 worth of credits)
You can:

Sign up at https://platform.openai.com

Get $5 of free credits on a new account

Use that to build and test your addon normally with the API

Switch to a paid plan only if needed

GPT-3.5 is free on API. GPT-4 is not, but you could simulate your ChatGPT Plus behavior using 3.5 and save money.

🔄 Option 4: External Recommendation System
Skip GPT entirely and use an existing source like:

TMDB “trending” API

Trakt.tv recommendations

Reddit “Top this week” scraped from /r/moviesuggestions

Then later add GPT for text-based personalization once the system’s up.

💡 How the Results Would Link in Stremio
No matter how you generate the list of titles, you'd still need to:

Turn them into Stremio-compatible meta objects (with id, type, name, poster, etc.)

Link to real stream sources (optional) — from:

Torrentio + RealDebrid

External APIs (like YouTube for trailers or TMDB for metadata)

Present them in your custom tab like “ChatGPT Recommended”

Stremio uses those titles' ids to search its internal plugin ecosystem for streams. You don’t have to provide the full stream unless you want to.

Want Me to Help Set One Up Locally?
If you’re down, I can:

Set up a local version using GPT-3.5 API (free credits)

Walk you through replacing GPT with static or randomized data

Help you switch later to an automated “scrape-GPT-chat” if you’re feeling chaotic 😅

Let me know how far you want to take this—safe dev route or risky hack route?
